#  Identify relevant galaxy properties

Summary -- Define the common observational properties that will need to be controlled and
validated (e.g. size, shape, flux, and light profile.)

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS1.1.1 ( 12/15 ): Schedule and conduct a first meeting of interested parties to
identify the specific quantities that need to be standardized.
* Key Task CS1.1.2 ( 12/15 ): Assemble all standard methods for calculating identified
properties.
* Key Task CS1.1.3 ( 12/15 ): Deliver first version of document outlining galaxy properties
of interest (Confluence?).
